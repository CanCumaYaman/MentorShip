# MentorShip
This is my Asp.Net Core SignalR App. The main purpose is help students with mentor who dont know career road map.  

We can register the system as a student or mentor. Then we can sign in.

For example you are a computer engineer student and you dont know exactly your road map or you have a unknown problem with your job. You can sign up system. After login, main page appears.

Then you can generate your resume, you can change your account information, you can list all mentor and you can filter the mentors which one have same departmant with you.

Then you can chat mentor with your unique connection id. Chat is real time.
